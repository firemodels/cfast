\section{Flame Height}

Flame height is recorded by visual observations, photographs, or video footage.  Videos from the NIST/NRC test series and photographs from the VTT Large Hall Test Series are available.  It is difficult to precisely measure the flame height, but the photos and videos allow one to make estimates accurate to within a pan diameter.

\subsubsection{VTT Large Hall Test Series}

The height of the visible flame in the photographs has been estimated to be between 2.4 and 3 pan diameters (3.8 m to 4.8 m).  From the CFAST calculations, the estimated flame height is 4.3 m.

\subsubsection{NIST/NRC Test Series}

CFAST estimates the peak flame height to be 2.8 m, consistent with the roughly 3 m flame height observed through the doorway during the test.  The test series was not designed to record accurate measurements of flame height.

\subsubsection{NIST/Navy High Bay Hangar Test Series}

For the 9 Iceland tests, CFAST predicts flame height within 25~\% of the experimentally reported values, with the largest relative differences for the smaller heat release rate fires. Uncertainty in the flame height measurements for the experiments was reported to be $\pm$ 0.5 m, approaching 30~\% of the experimental values for the lower heat release rate fires.

\section{Plume Temperature}

As with the ceiling jet, CFAST includes a specific plume temperature model based on the McCaffrey plume \cite{Baum:1989, McCaffrey:1983} to account for presence of higher gas temperatures near a target located at the centerline of the fire plume. the correlation has been subjected to extensive validation efforts by McCaffrey \cite{Baum:1989} and others \cite{Valid:Davis_Plumes} and shown to provide predictions within about 30 \% of a wide range of experimental results \cite{Valid:Davis_Plumes}. In the model, this increased temperature has the effect of increasing the convective heat transfer to the target. Only two of the six test series (VTT and FM/SNL) included measurements of plume centerline temperature.

Figure \ref{fig:Plume_Temp_Scatter} shows a comparison of predicted and measured values for plume temperature. Appendix B provides individual graphs of model and experimental values. All of the comparisons are to the surrounding gas temperature predicted by CFAST. Comparisons to the target surface temperature or target center temperature would be expected to have a smaller relative difference since all the predictions of surrounding gas temperature are higher than experimental measurements. Following is a summary of the predictions in the two test series.

\end{figure}

Based on the model physics and comparisons of model predictions with experimental measurements, the following comments on the prediction plume temperature are noted:

\begin{itemize}
\item The correlation used in CFAST to predict plume temperature is well-suited for this application and has been subjected to extensive validation efforts.
\item CFAST tends to over-predict plume temperatures comparing experimental measurements to gas temperature predictions by the model.  Comparisons to target surface or center temperature (which may be appropriate for unshielded thermocouple measurements in experiments) show closer agreement.
\item The predictions by CFAST are typically within \Plumeavg~\% of experimental measurements.
\end{itemize}

\section{Ceiling Jets}

CFAST includes an algorithm to account for the presence of the higher gas temperatures near the ceiling surfaces in compartments involved in a fire.  In the model, this increased temperature has the effect of increasing the convective heat transfer to ceiling surfaces.  The temperature and velocity of the ceiling jet are also available from the model by placing a heat detector at the specified location.  The ceiling jet algorithm is based on the model Alpert and Heskestad~\cite{Alpert:SFPE}, with details described in the CFAST Technical Reference Guide \cite{CFAST_Tech_Guide_7}.  The algorithm predicts gas temperature and velocity under a flat, unconstrained ceiling above a fire source.  Only two of the six test series (NIST/NRC and FM/SNL) involved relatively large flat ceilings.

Figure \ref{fig:Ceiling_Jet_Scatter} shows a comparison of predicted and measured values for ceiling jet temperature. Appendix B provides individual graphs of model and experimental values. Following is a summary of the accuracy assessment for the ceiling jet predictions.
\label{Flat Ceiling Jet Temperature}

\end{center}
\caption{Comparison of Measured and Predicted Ceiling Jet Temperature.} \label{fig:Ceiling_Jet_Scatter}
\end{figure}

\begin{itemize}
\item For tests with a well-defined ceiling jet layer beneath flat ceilings, CFAST predicts ceiling jet temperatures well-within experimental uncertainty.
\item For tests with a less well-defined ceiling jet layer, CFAST over-predicts the ceiling jet temperature.  For the tests studied, over-predictions were noted when the HGL temperature was below 70~$^\circ$C.
\item The UL/NIST Vents tests show particularly high ceiling jet temperature estimates compared to experimental data.  Like the upper layer temperature predictions, this is likely due to the large size of the vents relative to those included in the oroginal experimental correlations used by CFAST.
\end{itemize}

\section{Device Activation}

Smoke detector, heat detector, and sprinkler activations are all treated similarly in CFAST.  Device activation is modeled using temperatures and velocities from the ceiling jet.  For rooms without a fire (which do not have a ceiling jet), the upper layer temperature (and a default velocity of 0.1 m/s) is used.  Devices are described with a characteristic activation temperature and response time index (RTI). The RTI a measure of the sensor's sensitivity to temperature change (thermal inertia). For heat detectors and sprinklers, the activation temperature and RTI values are part of the device specification. For smoke detectors, a temperature rise of 10~\degc and RTI of 5~(m s)$^{1/2}$ were used, consistent with values in NUREG 1805 \cite{NRCNUREG1805}. With these inputs, the characteristic detector temperature is modeled using the differential equation \cite{Heskestad:1976}

\be \frac{dT_L}{dt} = \frac{\sqrt{v(t)}}{RTI} \brackets{T_g(t) - T_L(t)} \; , \; T_L(0) = T_g(0)  \ee

where $T_L$ and $T_g$ are the link and gas temperatures, $v$ is the gas velocity, and $RTI$.

Figure \ref{fig:Activation_Scatter} shows a comparison of predicted and measured values for activation times. Appendix B provides individual graphs of model and experimental values.

\caption{Comparison of Measured and Predicted Ceiling Jet Temperature.} \label{fig:Activation_Scatter}
\end{figure}

Sprinkler and smoke detector activation are particularly challenging for a zone fire model since activation depends on conditions local to the device.
\begin{itemize}
\item With exception, estimates of sprinkler activation time are typically near experimental uncertainty. Tests with obstructions at the ceiling are notably underpredicted since zone models do not account for the more complex geometry of the ceiling surface.
\item Estimates of smoke detector activation show a wide spread outside the experimental uncertainty.  This is likely due both to the simple, temperature-based criteria used by the model to predict activation time and due to the very low temperature rise at device activation.
\end{itemize}
