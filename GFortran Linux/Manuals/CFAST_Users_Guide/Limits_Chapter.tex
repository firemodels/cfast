\chapter{Scenario and Software Limits}

CFAST is intended for use with a wide variety of fire scenarios.  A number of limits to the inputs in the software implementation of the model are noted below.

\begin{tabular}{|p{15cm}|c|}
\hline
Maximum simulation time in seconds & 86400 \\ \hline
Maximum number of compartments & 100 \\ \hline
Maximum number of horizontal flow (door/window) vent connections that can be included in a single test case & 2500 \\ \hline
Maximum number of vertical flow (ceiling/floor) vent connections which can be included in a single test case & 2500 \\ \hline
Maximum total number of connections between compartments and mechanical ventilation systems which can be included in a single test case & 2500 \\ \hline
Maximum number of fans that can be included in a single test cases  & 1250 \\ \hline

Maximum number of fires which can be included in a single test case & 2500 \\ \hline
Maximum number of data points for a single  fire definition & 199 \\ \hline
Maximum number of data points in a variable cross-sectional area definition for a single compartment & 199 \\ \hline
Maximum number of material thermal property definitions which can be included in a single thermal database file & 2500 \\ \hline
