%This script will calculate the experimental and theoretical yields of H2O
%and CO2 for several test cases. The program functions by reading in
%values from the specific .csv files. The program finds values of
%Temperature, Pressure and Volume of the upper layer, as well as
%the corresponding mole fractions of O2, CO2 and H2O in the upper layer,
%which are then used to calculate the experimental masses of CO2 and H2O produced.
