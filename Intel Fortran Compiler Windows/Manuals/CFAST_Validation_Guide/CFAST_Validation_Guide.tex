\chapter{Disclaimer}

The U. S. Department of Commerce makes no warranty, expressed or implied, to users of
CFAST and associated computer programs, and accepts no responsibility for its use.  Users of
CFAST assume sole responsibility under Federal law for determining the appropriateness of its
use in any particular application; for any conclusions drawn from the results of its use; and for
any actions taken or not taken as a result of analyses performed using these tools.
CFAST is intended for use only by those competent in the field of fire safety and is intended
only to supplement the informed judgment of a qualified user. The software package is a
computer model which may or may not have predictive value when applied to a specific set of
factual circumstances. Lack of accurate predictions by the model could lead to erroneous
conclusions with regard to fire safety. All results should be evaluated by an informed user.

\chapter{Intent and Use}

The algorithms, procedures, and computer programs described in this report constitute a
methodology for predicting some of the consequences resulting from a prescribed fire.  They
have been compiled from the best knowledge and understanding currently available, but have
important limitations that must be understood and considered by the user.  The program is
intended for use by persons competent in the field of fire safety and with some familiarity with
personal computers. It is intended as an aid in the fire safety decision-making process.

\chapter{Abstract}

This volume of the CFAST Technical Reference Guide provides details of the verification and validation process. It is based in part on the ``Standard Guide for Evaluating the Predictive Capability of Deterministic Fire Models,'' ASTM~E1355~\cite{CFAST:ASTM:E1355}. ASTM~E~1355 defines {\em model evaluation} as ``the process of quantifying the accuracy of chosen results from a model when applied for a specific use.'' The model evaluation process consists of two main components: verification and validation. {\em Verification} is a process to check the correctness of the solution of the governing equations. Verification does not imply that the governing equations are appropriate; only that the equations are being solved correctly. {\em Validation} is a process to determine the appropriateness of the governing equations as a mathematical model of the physical phenomena of interest. Typically, validation involves comparing model results with experimental measurement. Differences that cannot be explained in terms of numerical errors in the model or uncertainty in the measurements are attributed to the assumptions and simplifications of the physical model.


\chapter{Acknowledgments}

\label{acksection}

The following individuals and organizations played a role in the validation process of CFAST.
\begin{itemize}
\item Continuing support for CFAST is via internal funding at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

\item In addition, support is provided by other agencies of the U.S. Federal Government, most notably the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) Office of Research and the U.S. Department of Energy. The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission Office of Research has funded key validation experiments, the preparation of the CFAST manuals, and the development of various sub-models that are of importance in the area of nuclear power plant safety. Special thanks to Mark Salley, David Stroup, and Jason Dreisbach for their efforts and support. Support to refine the software development and quality assurance process for CFAST has been provided by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The assistance of Subir Sen and Debra Sparkman in understanding DOE software quality assurance programs and the application of the process to CFAST is gratefully acknowledged.  Thanks are also due to Allan Coutts, Washington Safety Management Solutions for his insight into the application of fire models to nuclear safety applications and detailed review of the CFAST document updates for DOE.

\item Anthony Hamins of NIST directed the NIST/NRC and WTC experiments, and quantified the experimental uncertainty of these and other experiments used in this study. Alex Maranghides was the Director of the Large Fire Laboratory at NIST at the time these tests were conducted, and he helped to design the experiments. Therese McAllister oversaw the instrumentation of the structural steel during the WTC experiments.

\item Anthony Hamins developed the technique of evaluating experimental uncertainty that is used throughout this Guide.

\item Kevin McGrattan and Randy McDermott of the Fire Research Division at NIST developed the automated process for validation and verification testing of the Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS) model.  We use this same process for validation and verification testing of CFAST.

\item Kevin McGrattan of the Fire Research Division and Blaza Toman of the Statistical Engineering Division of NIST developed the method of quantifying the model uncertainty.

\item For the NIST/NRC tests, Alex Maranghides was in charge of the Large Fire Laboratory at NIST where these tests were conducted, and helped to design the experiments. Thanks also to technicians Laurean Delauter, Jay McElroy, and Jack Lee who constructed and conducted these validation experiments at NIST.

\item Steve Nowlen, formerly at Sandia National Laboratories provided data, documentation and further information for the NRC-sponsored experiments referred to in this document and the "FM/SNL Test Series" (Factory Mutual and Sandia National Laboratories conducted these experiments).

\item Thanks to VTT, Finland, for their contribution of experimental data, referred to in this document as the ``VTT Large Hall Experiments.''

\item Bryan Klein, currently employed at Thunderhead Engineering, Inc., assisted in the development of techniques to automatically generate the plots that are found throughout this Guide.

\item David Sheppard, currently of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), conducted the experiments referred to as the ``UL/NFPRF Test Series'' on behalf of the Fire Protection Research Foundation (then known as the National Fire Protection Research Foundation) while working at Underwriters Labs in Northbrook, Illinois. Sheppard, along with Bryan Klein, currently employed at Thunderhead Engineering, Inc., conducted the experiments referred to as the ``ATF Corridors'' series in 2008.

\item Ken Steckler provided details about the ``Steckler Compartment Experiments'' of 1979.

\item Michael Spearpoint and masters degree student Rob Fleury of the University of Canterbury, New Zealand, supplied heat flux measurements from propane burner fires (Fleury Heat Flux).

\item Taylor Myers, a student at the University of Maryland and a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow (SURF) at NIST, analyzed the Vettori Flat sprinkler experiments. Thanks also to Bob Vettori of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and formerly of NIST for his help in locating the original test data and laboratory notebooks. Taylor Myers also analyzed the NIST Home Smoke Alarm (Dunes 2000) experiments and the WTC Spray Burner experiments using CFAST.

\item Barbara Hall, a student at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and a summer intern at NIST, analyzed the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory experiments using CFAST.

\item Tony Feric, a student at the University of Maryland and a summer intern at NIST, developed many of the verification tests included in this guide.

\item Brianna Gillespie, a student at the Worcester Polytechnic Institute and a summer intern at NIST, also contributed to the verification tests included in this guide.

\chapter{Summary of Verification Results}
\label{info:verification_statistics}

This appendix summarizes the accuracy of results from cases in the CFAST verification suite. These metrics are an integral part of a process known as regression testing, which aims to evaluate the accuracy of output predicted by a numerical software package. The results from this appendix can be compared to another version of CFAST as a way of measuring the quality of results between revisions. These statistical metrics also help determine the impact of code additions on the overall accuracy of CFAST and can help identify errors in the CFAST source code.
