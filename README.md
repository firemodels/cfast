## Consolidated Fire and Smoke Transport (CFAST)

CFAST is a two-zone fire model that predicts the thermal environment caused by a fire within a compartmented structure.

Smokeview (SMV) is a visualization program used to display the output of [FDS](https://github.com/firemodels/fds) and CFAST simulations.
