\chapter{Description of Validation Experiments}

\label{Experiment_Chapter}

This chapter contains a brief description of the experiments that were used for model validation. Only enough detail is included here to provide a general understanding of the model simulations. Anyone wishing to use the experimental measurements for validation ought to consult the cited test reports or other publications for a comprehensive description.

Much of the content follows the FDS Validation Guide \cite{FDS_Validation_Guide_6} and the verification and validation guide for nuclear power plants developed by the US NRC \cite{NRCNUREG1824}. This study focused on the predicted results of the CFAST fire model and did not include an assessment of the user interface for the model.  However, all input files used for the simulations were prepared using the CFAST graphical user interface (GUI) and reviewed for correctness prior to the simulations.  The comparisons between the experiments and model predictions were characterized as open calculations, i.e., the modelers were given detailed descriptions of the test conditions, test geometry, and fire source, but did not modify model inputs from these given conditions to improve model predictions.  As such, the comparisons in this report provide an assessment of the predictive capability of the model, but not an assessment of the ability of different modelers to develop appropriate model inputs.

\section{ATF Corridors Experiments}

A series of eighteen experiments were conducted in a two-story structure with long hallways and a connecting stairway
in the large burn room of the ATF Fire Research Laboratory in Ammendale, Maryland, in 2008~\cite{Sheppard:Corridors}.
The test enclosure consisted of two 17.0~m long hallways connected by a
stairway consisting of two staircases and an intermediary landing.
There was a door at the opposite end of the first floor hallway, which was closed during all tests.
The end of the second floor hallway was open with a soffit near the ceiling.

The walls and ceilings of the test structure were constructed of 1.2~cm gypsum wallboard.
The flooring throughout the structure, including the stairwell landing floor, consisted of one layer of 1.3~cm thick cement board on one
layer of 1.9~cm thick plywood supported by wood joists. The first set of stairs, which had eight risers, led from the first floor up to the landing area.
The second set of stairs, which had nine risers, led from the landing area up to the second floor.
The stairs were constructed of 2.5~cm thick clear pine lumber. The two set of stairs were separated by an approximately 0.42~m wide gap in the middle of the stairwell.
This gap was separated from the stairs by a 0.91~m tall barrier constructed of a single piece of gypsum board.
The flue space was open to the first floor.  The flue space was separated from the second floor by a 0.9~m tall barrier constructed of gypsum board.
There was a metal exterior type door at the end of the first floor near the burner.  The door was closed during all experiments.

The fire source was a natural gas diffusion flame burner.  The burner surface was horizontal, square and 0.45~m on each side, its surface was 0.37~m above the floor, and it was filled with gravel.
The burner was located near the end of the first floor away from the stairs. A diagram of the test structure is displayed in Figure~\ref{ATF Drawing}.

\section{DelCo Trainer Experiments}
\label{DelCo_Description}

The NIST Fire Fighting Technology Group conducted a series of experiments in two structures of similar design located at the Delaware County (``DelCo'') Emergency Services Training Center in Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania~\cite{DelCo_TN}. Three propane burners were used to provide the fire source for all experiments, and various sensors were used to collect gas temperature, gas velocity, heat flux, and gas concentration measurements throughout the structure.

The single level structure was instrumented with five bare-bead thermocouple arrays and two gas sample inlet pipes at the locations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:east_instrumentation}. Both floors of the two level structure were instrumented with three bare-bead thermocouple arrays and one gas sample inlet pipe at the locations shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:west_instrumentation}.

\section{Fleury Heat Flux Measurements}

Rob Fleury, a masters degree student at the University of Canterbury in Christchurch, New Zealand, measured the heat flux from a variety of propane fires~\cite{Fleury:Masters}.
The objective of the work was to evaluate a variety of empirical heat flux calculation methods. For the measurements, heat flux gauges were mounted on moveable dollies that
were placed in front of, and to the side of, burners with dimensions of 0.3~m by 0.3~m (1:1 burner), 0.6~m by 0.3~m (2:1 burner), and 0.9~m by 0.3~m (3:1 burner). The heat release
rates were set to 100~kW, 150~kW, 200~kW, 250~kW, and 300~kW. The gauges were mounted at heights of 0~m, 0.5~m, 1.0~m, and 1.5~m relative to the top edge of the burner.

\section{FM Four Room Including Corridor Test Series}

This data set describes a series of tests conducted in a multiple room configuration with more complex gas burner fires than the previous data set.  This study \cite{Heskestad:1986} was included because, in many ways, it is similar to the smoke movement study performed at NBS \cite{Peacock:1988}, and permits comparisons between two different laboratories. In addition, it expands upon that data set by providing larger a time-varying gas burner fires in a room-corridor configuration. Fire size was about up to 1 MW with a total volume of 200 m$^3$.

This study was performed to collect data allowing for variations in fire source, ventilation, and geometry in a multi-compartment structure, especially for situations with closed doors. This test program was carried out at Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC) in West Glocester, RI, in which 60 fire experiments were conducted in a multiple-room enclosure to furnish validation data for theoretical fire models.

Figure \ref{fig:FMSummary} shows a diagram of the basic facility with indications of instrumentation location. The facility was built on the floor of FMRC's fire test building, using part of the 67 m by 76 m test building where the ceiling height is 18.3 m. The layout in figure 25 shows a burn room and two target rooms connected to a corridor. The corridor was 2.43 m wide x 18.89 m long x 2.43 m high. The burn room measured 3.63 m deep x 3.64 m wide x 2.45 m high; a sealable window opening, measuring 0.85 m square, was centered on the rear wall, 0.34 m down from the top, and a door, measuring 0.92 m by 2.05 m high, was centered on the front wall (opening to the corridor). For closed window experiments, the wood-framed calcium silicate board window cover was pressed against a bead of caulking around the steel window frame and held by drop bars positioned into slots on the outside wall.

\end{figure}

Room 3, located opposite the burn room, measured 3.65 m deep x 3.64 m wide x 2.45 m high; a door, measuring 0.88 m by 2.02 m high, was centered on the front wall (opening to the corridor). Room 4, located at the opposite end of the corridor, measured 3.65 m deep x 3.65 m wide x 2.43 m high and had a 0.88 m by 2.02 m high door centered on the front wall (opening to the corridor); an observation alcove, measuring 1.28 m by 0.86 m by 1.99 m high, was located in the front corner of room 4. Each room was equipped with a 102~mm inside diameter vent tube with a 61 mm inside diameter orifice meter and thermocouple, with option of exhaust fan (tube centered 0.27 m from the floor and 0.17 m from the closest parallel wall). An inlet vent (0.29 m$^2$) used with exhaust fans was centered 0.43 m above the floor at the end of the corridor between the burn room and room 3. When not in use, the inlet vent was sealed with a gypsum board cover taped in place.

The target room doors were commercial fire doors (wood-faced composite doors with calcium silicate cores, 14 h rated) mounted on 16 gage steel frames. The burn room door was fabricated from 12.7 mm calcium silicate, mounted in a steel frame lined with calcium silicate. Details of the doors and the spacings (cracks) are given in the original reference \cite{Heskestad:1986}.

Gypsum wallboard, 12.7 mm thick, on wood studs was used throughout the experimental facility. In addition, the walls and ceiling of the burn room were overlaid with calcium silicate, also 12.7 mm thick, to harden against repeated fire exposure. The existing concrete floor of the test building was used.

Two types of fire sources were used: 1) steady propylene fires at 56 kW on a 0.30 m diameter sand burner and 522 kW on a 0.91 m diameter burner and 2) propylene fires on the 0.91 m diameter burner programmed under computer control to grow with the square of time, exceeding 1 MW in 1, 2, 4, or 8 min.

The 0.91 m diameter, 0.58 in high propylene burner was used for most of the tests. Its design consisted of a 12 gage steel container with a gas distributor near the bottom, filled with gravel to a 67 percent height, where there was wire mesh screen, and coarse sand to the full height of the burner. The 0.30 m diameter burner was a scaled-down version of similar design.

\section{FM / SNL Test Series}

The Factory Mutual and Sandia National Laboratories (FM/SNL) test series consists of 25 compartment fire experiments conducted in 1985 for the U.S.~Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) by Factory Mutual Research Corporation (FMRC), under the direction of Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)~\cite{Nowlen:NUREG4681,Nowlen:NUREG4527}. The primary purpose of these experiments was to provide data with which to validate computer models for various types of compartments typical of nuclear power plants. The experiments were conducted in an enclosure measuring approximately 18~m long by 12~m wide by 6~m high, constructed at the FMRC fire test facility in Rhode Island. A drawing is included in Fig.~\ref{FM_SNL_Drawing}. All of the experiments included forced ventilation to simulate typical power plant conditions. Six of the experiments were conducted with a full-scale control room mock-up in place. Parameters varied during the experiments included fire intensity, enclosure ventilation rate, and fire location. Only data from nineteen experiments (Tests 1-17, 21, and 22) is used in the current study. In these experiments, the fires were fueled by a propylene gas burner, and heptane and methanol liquid pools. In the experiments not selected, the heat release was not reported and could not be estimated with confidence. Table~\ref{FM_SNL_Matrix} lists the test parameters.

The following information was provided by the test director, Steve Nowlen of Sandia National Laboratory. In particular, Tests 4, 5, and 21 were given extra attention.
\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate:] The HRR was determined using oxygen consumption calorimetry in the exhaust stack with a correction applied for the carbon dioxide in the upper layer of the compartment. The uncertainty of the fuel mass flow was not documented. Several tests selected for this study had the same target peak heat release rate of 516~kW following a 4~min ``t-squared'' growth profile. The test report contains time histories of the measured HRR, for which the average, sustained HRR following the ramp up for Tests 4, 5, and 21 have been estimated as 510~kW, 480~kW, and 470~kW, respectively. Once reached, the peak HRR was maintained essentially constant during a steady-burn period of 6~min in Tests~4 and 5, and 16~min in Test~21. Note that in Test 21, Nowlen reports a ``significant'' loss of effluent from the exhaust hood that could lead to an under-estimate of the HRR towards the end of the experiment.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] The radiative fraction was not measured during the experiment, but in this study it is assumed to equal 0.35, which is typical for a smoky hydrocarbons. It was further assumed that the radiative fraction was about the same in Test~21 as the other tests, as fuel burning must have occurred outside of the electrical cabinet in which the burner was placed.
\item[Measurements:] Four types of measurements were conducted during the FM/SNL test series that are used in the current model evaluation study, including the HGL temperature and depth, and the ceiling jet and plume temperatures. Aspirated thermocouples (TCs) were used to make all of the temperature measurements. Generally, aspirated TC measurements are preferable to bare-bead TC measurements, as systematic radiative exchange measurement error is reduced.
\item[HGL Depth and Temperature:] Data from all of the vertical TC trees were used when reducing the HGL height and temperature. For the majority of the tests, Sectors 1, 2, and 3 were used, all weighted evenly. For Tests 21 and 22, Sectors 1 and 3 were used, evenly weighted. Sector 2 was partially within the fire plume.

\section{iBMB Compartment Tests}

A series of small compartment kerosene pool fire experiments, conducted at the Institut f\"ur Baustoffe, Massivbau und Brandschutz (iBMB) of Braunschweig University of Technology in Germany in 2004 ~\cite{Klein-Helbetaling:2005}. These experiments involved relatively large fires in a relatively small (3.6 m by 3.6 m by 5.7 m) concrete enclosure. Figure~\ref{fig:iBMB_Pool_Detailed} shows plan, side and perspective schematic drawings of the experimental arrangement, including the location of the fuel pan, which was located at the center of the compartment.

\section{LLNL Enclosure Tests}

Sixty-four enclosure fire tests were conducted by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) in 1986 to study the effects of ventilation on enclosure fires~\cite{Foote:LLNL1986}. The test
enclosure was 6~m long, 4~m wide, and 4.5~m high. It contained a methane rock burner which was placed in the center of the space. For most of the tests the burner was placed on the
floor. The fires varied in size from 50~kW to 400~kW. The burner was 0.57~m in diameter and 0.23~m height.

The door (2.06 m high by 0.76 m wide) was closed and sealed for most tests, and air was pulled through the space at rates varying from 100 to 500~g/s. In some tests the enclosure included a plenum space, where
make-up air could be injected from above or below. The test matrix is listed in Table~\ref{LLNL_Matrix}.

\section{NBS Single Room Tests with Furniture}

These data describe a series of room fire tests using upholstered furniture items in a room of fixed size but with varying opening sizes and shapes \cite{Valid:Babrauskas_Flashover} conducted by the National Bureau of Standards (NBS, former name of NIST). It was selected for its well characterized and realistic fuel sources in a simple single-room geometry. In addition, the wide variation in opening size should provide challenges for current zone fire models. Peak fire size was about 2.9~MW with a total room volume of 21 m$^3$. A series of four single-room fire tests were conducted using upholstered furniture items for comparison with their free burning behavior, previously determined in a furniture calorimeter.  The experiments were conducted in a single room enclosure; ventilation to the room was provided by window openings of  varying sizes. The room was equipped with an instrumented exhaust collection system outside the window opening.

A second similar test series also utilized a single-room fire test with furniture as the fire source \cite{Lee:1985}. It expanded upon the first data set by adding the phenomenon of wall burning. Peak fire size was about 7 MW. The room size was similar to the first test series. Figure \ref{fig:NBSFurniture} illustrates the configuration for the two test series.

The test furniture included a 28.3 kg armchair or a similar 40.0 kg love seat for the first test series. Both were of conventional wood frame construction and used polyurethane foam padding, made to minimum California State flammability requirements, and polyolefin fabric. A single piece of test furniture and igniting wastebasket were the only combustibles in the test room.

For the second test series, room furnishings consisted of a 1.37 m wide x 1.91 m long x 0.53 m high double bed, a 2.39 m X 0.89 m high headboard, and 0.51 m wide x 0.41 m deep x 0.63 m high night table. Both headboard and night table were fabricated from 12.7 mm thick plywood. The bedding was comprised of two pillows, two pillow cases, two sheets, and one blanket. The pillows had a polypropylene fabric with a polyester filling. The pillow cases and sheets were polyester-cotton. The blanket was acrylic material. The bedding was left in a "slept in" condition which was duplicated to the degree possible in each test. In all of the tests, the fire was started with match flame ignition of a 0.34 kg (240 mm x 140 mm x 240 mm high) wastebasket, filled with 0.41 kg of trash, positioned adjacent to the bed.

\section{NBS Multi-Compartment Test Series}

The National Bureau of Standards (NBS, which is now called the National Institute of Standards and Technology, NIST) Multi-Room Experiments consisted of 45 fire tests representing 9 different sets of conditions were conducted in a three-room suite (see Figs.~\ref{fig:NBS_100kW_fire} and \ref{fig:NBS_Detailed}). The experiments were conducted in 1985 and are described in detail in Ref.~\cite{Peacock:1988}. The suite consisted of two relatively small rooms, connected via a relatively long corridor. The fire source, a gas burner, was located against the rear wall of one of the small compartments.  Fire tests of 100~kW, 300~kW and 500~kW were conducted. For the current study, only three 100~kW fire experiments have been used, including Test~100A from Set~1, Test~100O from Set~2, and Test~100Z from Set~4. These tests were selected because they had been used in prior validation studies, and because these tests had the steadiest values of measured heat release rate during the steady-burn period.

Following is additional information provided by the test director, Richard Peacock of NIST:
\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate:] In the two tests for which
the door was open, the HRR during the steady-burn period measured via oxygen consumption
calorimetry was 110~kW with an uncertainty of about 15~\%, consistent with the replicate
measurements made during the experimental series and the uncertainty typical of oxygen
consumption calorimetry. It was assumed that the closed door test (Test~100O) had the same HRR as the open
door tests.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] Natural gas was used as the fuel in
Test~100A. In Tests~100O and 100Z, acetylene was added to the natural gas to increase the
smoke yield, and as a consequence, the radiative fraction increased. The radiative fraction of
natural gas has been studied previously, whereas the radiative fraction of the acetylene/natural
gas mixture has not been studied. The radiative fraction for the natural gas fire was assigned a
value of 0.20, whereas a value of 0.30 was assigned for the natural gas/acetylene fires.
\item[Measurements:] Only two types of measurements conducted during the NBS test series were used in the
evaluation considered here, because there was less confidence in the other measurements.
The measurements considered here were the HGL temperature and depth, in which bare bead
TCs were used to make these measurements. Single point measurements of temperature within
the burn room were not used in the evaluation of plume or ceiling jet algorithms. This is because
the geometry was not consistent in either case with the assumptions used in the model algorithms
of plumes or jets. Specifically, the burner was mounted against a wall, and the room width-to-height
ratio was less than that assumed by the various ceiling jet correlations.

\section{NIST / NRC Compartment Experiments}


These experiments, sponsored by the US NRC and conducted at NIST, consisted of 15 large-scale experiments performed in June 2003. All 15 tests were included in the validation study. The experiments are documented in Ref.~\cite{Hamins:2005}. The fire sizes ranged from 350 kW to 2.2 MW in a compartment with dimensions 21.7~m by 7.1~m by 3.8~m high, designed to represent a compartment in a nuclear power plant containing power and control cables. A photo of the fire seen through the compartment doorway is shown in figure \ref{fig:NISTNRC_1MW_fire}. A diagram of the test structure is displayed in Figure~\ref{fig:NISTNRC_Detailed}.

The walls and ceiling were covered with two layers of marinate boards, each layer 0.0125~m thick. The floor
was covered with one layer of gypsum board on top of a layer of plywood. Thermo-physical and optical properties of the marinate
and other materials used in the compartment are given in Ref.~\cite{Hamins:2005}. The room had one door and a mechanical air injection and extraction
system. Ventilation conditions, the fire size, and fire location were varied. Numerous measurements (approximately 350 per test) were made including
gas and surface temperatures, heat fluxes and gas velocities.

Following are some notes provided by Anthony Hamins, who conducted the experiments:
\begin{description}
\item[Natural Ventilation:] The compartment had a 2~m by 2~m door in the middle of the west wall. Some of the tests had a closed door and no mechanical
ventilation (Tests 2, 7, 8, 13, and 17), and in those tests the measured compartment leakage was an important consideration. The test report lists leakage
areas based on measurements performed prior to Tests 1, 2, 7, 8, and 13. For the closed door tests, the leakage area used in the simulations was
based on the last available measurement. The chronological order of the tests differed from the numerical order.
For Test 4, the leakage area measured before Test 2 was used. For Tests 10 and 16, the leakage area
measured before Test 7 was used.
\item[Mechanical Ventilation:] The mechanical ventilation and exhaust was used during Tests 4, 5, 10, and 16, providing about 5 air changes per hour. The
door was closed during Test 4 and open during Tests 5, 10, and 16. The supply duct was positioned on the south wall, about 2~m off the floor. An
exhaust duct of equal area to the supply duct was positioned on the opposite wall at a comparable location. The flow rates through the supply and
exhaust ducts were measured in detail during breaks in the testing, in the absence of a fire. During the tests, the flows were monitored with single
bi-directional probes during the tests themselves.
\item[Heat Release Rate:] A single nozzle was used to spray liquid hydrocarbon fuels onto a 1~m by 2~m fire pan that was about 0.1~m deep. The test plan
originally called for the use of two nozzles to provide the fuel spray. Experimental observation suggested that the fire was less unsteady with the
use of a single nozzle. In addition, it was observed that the actual extent of the liquid pool was well-approximated by a 1~m circle in the
center of the pan. For safety reasons, the fuel flow was terminated when the lower-layer oxygen concentration
dropped to approximately 15~\% by volume.
The fuel used in 14 of the tests was heptane, while toluene was used for one test. The HRR was
determined using oxygen consumption calorimetry. The recommended uncertainty values
were 17~\% for all of the tests.
\item[Radiative Fraction:]  The values of radiative fraction and its uncertainty were reported as
\num{0.44 \pm 0.07} and \num{0.40 \pm 0.09} for heptane and toluene, respectively.
\item[Soot Yield:]  The values of the soot yield and its uncertainty were reported as \SI{0.0149 \pm 0.0033}{kg/kg}
and \SI{0.195 \pm 0.052}{kg/kg} for heptane and toluene, respectively.

\section{NIST/NRC Corner, Wall, and Cabinet Experiments}

In the summer of 2017, experiments were conducted in a large compartment in the NIST large fire laboratory on behalf of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. There were two sets of experiments. In the first set, conducted in July, 2017, a natural gas burner was positioned either in a corner or against a wall, and gradually moved outward. In the second set of experiments, conducted in September, 2017, a natural gas burner was placed inside one of two steel cabinets meant to represent typical industrial-scale electrical enclosures.

The compartment for all experiments was 11~m long, 7~m wide, and 3.8~m high. The long dimension of the compartment ran east-west. A 1.8~m wide, 2.4~m high door was centered on the east (short) wall.

All of the fires were fueled by one or more 30.5~cm (1~ft) square natural gas burners. Each burner was essentially a steel box, 30.5~cm square in plan and 15~cm deep, fueled from below. The lip of the burner was 2.5~cm (1~in) wide. A 2.5~cm thick piece of Kaowool insulation was placed under a steel mesh to form the surface of the burner.

\subsection{Wall and Corner Effects}

Six large compartment experiments were conducted in July, 2017, where four natural gas burners were positioned (1) in a corner and (2) against a wall, and then moved outward in stages until the corner or wall effect became negligible. The quad burner was 60~cm by 60~cm and the burner surface was 54~cm above the floor. The corner fire was located in the southwest corner of the large compartment. The wall fire was centered on the south (long) wall.

The experiments began with the quad burner in the corner or against the wall for the first 30~min. At 30~min, the burner was moved so that its edge(s) was 10~cm away from the wall(s). It remained for 15~min, after which it was moved to 20~cm, 30~cm, 50~cm, 100~cm, and 160~cm, each time remaining 15~min for a total experiment time of 2~h.

A three-dimensional array of thermocouples was positioned on a track mounted to the ceiling above the burner. The purpose of this array was to measure maximum plume temperatures at heights of 2.1~m, 2.7~m, and 3.4~m above the floor. As the burner moved, the thermocouple array moved with it. For the corner fire experiments, when the burner was at the 0~cm, 10~cm, and 20~cm positions, the thermocouple array overhead remained at its original location in the corner. As the burner moved beyond 20~cm, the thermocouple array was moved the same amount so that the burner was always below the array in the same position. In other words, for the corner fire experiments, after the center point of the burner reached the point directly below the position 18 on the diagram below, the burner and array moved together, maintaining their relative position.

The experimental data consists primarily of thermocouple measurements. The key to the column names are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item TC-AG-01 through TC-AG-29 are the thermocouples at the top of the cage, 46~cm below the ceiling (see pattern below).
\item TC-BG-01 through TC-BG-29 are the thermocouples at the mid-level of the cage, 107 cm below the ceiling (see pattern below).
\item TC-CG-01 through TC-CG-29 are the thermocouples at the bottom of the cage, 168 cm below the ceiling (see pattern below).
\item TC-WT-01 through TC-WT-13 are the thermocouples of the vertical array called the West Tree. The array was 2.75 m from the west (short) wall and 3.5 m from the south (long) wall. TC-WT-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.
\item TC-ET-01 through TC-ET-13 are the thermocouples of the East Tree. The array was 2.75 m from the east (short) wall and 3.5 m from the south (long) wall. TC-ET-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.
\item TC-C-01 through TC-C-11 are the thermocouples 2 cm from the corner above the corner fire. TC-C-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.
\item TC-W-01 through TC-W-11 are the thermocouples 2 cm from the wall above the wall fire. TC-W-01 was located 2 cm below the ceiling, and the rest were spaced 30 cm apart.
\item HRR (cal) is the heat release rate of the fire as measured using oxygen consumption calorimetry. HRR (NG) is the heat release rate determined from the mass flow rate of natural gas.

The East and West Tree thermocouples were used to estimate the height of the hot gas layer (HGL), and the average temperatures of the upper and lower layers. Also, the three horizontal arrays of thermocouples above the burner were processed by first taking a 2~min running average of each TC, and then choosing the maximum value for each of the three elevations above the fire. These were taken as approximate centerline plume temperatures at each height. These experimental files are labelled with ``HGL'' and ``Plume'', respectively.

\subsection{Cabinet Effects}

In this second series of experiments, conducted in September, 2017, two different mock steel cabinets were used. Each cabinet was constructed of 12 gauge (2.8~mm or 7/64~in) steel plate with openings as shown in Figs.~\ref{Large_Cabinet} and \ref{Medium_Cabinet}. The large cabinet was nominally 0.9~m by 0.9~m by 2.1~m and the medium size cabinet was 0.6~m by 0.6~m by 2.1~m. The openings near the top of each cabinet were sometimes covered with a steel grill, shown in Fig.~\ref{cabinet_grill}.

\end{figure}


For the first set of experiments (1-6), the large cabinet was positioned with its front opening facing eastward towards the opening of the test compartment. Its left side was 1.8~m from the south wall and its front side was 5.8~m from the east wall. Two 0.3~m by 0.3~m natural gas burners were placed side by side in the cabinet from the perspective of the cabinet front opening. The top of the burner was 50~cm above the floor of the cabinet. For Tests~1-4, the front door of the cabinet was closed, and the heat release rate was initially set to 50~kW for 30~min, then it was increased to 100~kW for 15~min, 200~kW for 15~min, and 400~kW for 15~min. For Tests~5-6, the front door was opened, and the heat release rate was set to 200~kW, 400~kW, and 700~kW for 15~min each, and then 1000~kW for 5~min, a total of 50~min.

In the second set of experiments (7-10), the medium-sized cabinet was positioned so that its front was the same distance from the east wall as the large cabinet, and its left side was 2.0 m (6.5 ft) from the south wall. A single 30~cm by 30~cm gas burner was centered within. For the closed door tests, the heat release rate was 25~kW, 50~kW, 100~kW, and 200~kW, each for 15~min. For the open door tests, the heat release rate was 40~kW, 80~kW, 200~kW, and 325~kW, each for 15~min.

In the third set of experiments (11-12), the cabinet was removed, and two 30~cm by 30~cm burners were spaced 0.9~m (3~ft) apart, side to side. One of the burners was centered under the array of thermocouples. Both burners were 2.0~m from the south wall. These experiments used the same heat release rate sequence as the open and closed door large cabinet experiments.

The data files for these experiments are labelled, {\ct NIST\_NRC\_Cabinet\_Test\_n.csv}. These files contain the same measurement positions as the corner and wall experiments, with the following additional measurements:
\begin{itemize}
\item PT-1 through PT-8 are plate thermometers positioned 0.6~m (2 ft) from each side of the cabinet at heights of 0.8~m (2.5~ft) and 1.4~m (4.5~ft). PT-1 is the upper plate on the left side. PT-2 is lower left. PT-3 is upper back. PT-4 is lower back. PT-5 is upper front. PT-6 is lower front. PT-7 is upper right. PT-8 is lower right.
\item STC-1 through STC-6 are sheathed thermocouples within the cabinet, 15 cm (6 in) from the left side, centered. STC-1 is 6~cm (2.5~in) from the top. STC-2 through STC-6 are 30~cm, 60~cm, 90~cm, 120~cm, and 150~cm from the top, respectively.
\item TC-Cab is a single 24 gauge Type K thermocouple welded to the center of the back side on the outside of the cabinet. For Test~11, this TC was placed just under the Kaowool surface of the burner, and for Test~12, it was placed just above the surface.
\end{itemize}
The three dimensional array of thermocouples used in the wall and corner experiments was positioned over the front of the cabinet, such that TC positions 1, 7, 13, 19, and 25 in Fig.~\ref{TC_pattern} were just above the upper front edge of the cabinet.

The test matrix is as follows:

\section{NIST Seven-story Hotel Tests}

By far the most complex test, this data set is part of  a series of full-scale experiments conducted to evaluate zoned smoke control systems, with and without stairwell pressurization cite{Klote:1990}.  It was conducted in a seven story hotel with multiple rooms on each floor and a stairwell connecting all floors.  This data set was chosen because it would challenge the scope of most current fire models.  Measured temperatures and pressure differences between the rooms and floors of the building are extensive and consistent.  Peak fire size was 3 MW with a total building volume of 140~000 m$^3$.

Smoke movement and the performance of smoke control systems were studied in a seven story hotel building with smoke generated from wood fires and theatrical smoke. A total of 12 single experiments were conducted under a variety of conditions: two different fire sizes; sprinklered vs non-sprinklered wood fires; zoned smoke control on or off; stairwell pressurization on or off; with and without ventilation to the outside; and open and closed doors.

The Plaza Hotel building was a masonry structure consisting of two wings, one three stories and the other seven stories tall. The two wings were built at different times. The wings were connected to each other at only one location on each floor. The connections between the wings at each floor were sealed off, and the fires were set on the second floor of the seven-story wing, using the shorter wing as an instrumentation area. Areas of the second floor were fire hardened to minimize structural damage to the building.

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Overview of the NIST Seven-story hotel test series including smoke control.}
 \label{fig:PlazaSummary}
\end{figure}

The smoke control systems were designed using the methods presented in the smoke control manual of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers \cite{Klote:1983}, and the design analysis is discussed in detail by Klote \cite{Klote:1988}. The minimum design pressure difference was 25 Pa, meaning that the system should be able to maintain at least this value without a fire. The Plaza Hotel building had no central forced air heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) system, so a dedicated system of fans and ducts was installed for zoned smoke control and stairwell pressurization. The smoke control system consisted of the three 0.944 m$^3$/s centrifugal fans shown in \ref{fig:PlazaSummary}, plus another centrifugal fan (not shown) located outside and supplying 4.25 m$^3$/s of pressurization air to the stairwell at the first floor. The smoke control system is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:PlazaSummary}. All the test fires were located in the second floor smoke zone. This smoke was exhausted at about six air changes per hour. The first and second floors were pressurized at about six air changes per hour. When the stairwell pressurization system was activated, the exterior stairwell door was open. This approach is intended to minimize fluctuations due to opening and closing doors.

\section{NIST Smoke Alarm Experiments}

A series of experiments was conducted by NIST to measure the activation time of ionization and photoelectric
smoke alarms in a residential setting~\cite{Bukowski:1}. Tests were conducted in actual homes with
representative sizes and floor plans, utilized actual furnishings and household items for fire sources,
and tested actual smoke alarms sold in retail stores at that time. Thirty-six tests were conducted in two
homes; 27 in a single-story manufactured home, and 8 in a two-story home.

Figure~\ref{NIST_Dunes_2000_Drawing} shows a diagram of the layout and instrumentation in the
manufactured home. The primary partitioning of the 84.7~m$^2$ floor plan consisted of three bedrooms:
one full bathroom, one kitchen/dining area, one living room, and two hallways. For testing, the doors
to bedroom 3 and the bathroom were always closed. The ceiling
was peaked on the long axis, reaching a height of 2.4~m. The outside walls
were approximately 2.1~m in height. The slope of the ceiling was approximately 8.4$^\circ$.

\caption[Geometry of the NIST Home Smoke Alarm Experiments]{Geometry of the NIST Smoke Alarm Experiments.}
\label{NIST_Dunes_2000_Drawing}
\end{figure}

An upholstered chair, mattress, or pan of cooking oil was used as the fire source in each test.
There were three primary ignition sources: flaming, smoldering, and cooking.
The flaming ignition source used a moderate flame source to quickly ignite the fuel package.
Groups of smoke alarms were located in the room of fire origin, at least one bedroom, and
in a central location. Five stations (A-E) containing smoke alarm arrays were mounted parallel to the ceiling.

Nine experiments that were conducted in the single-story manufactured home were selected for model validation.
Only tests that used a flaming ignition source with a couch or mattress fuel package were considered;
the cooking oil fires and tests that used a smoldering ignition source were not considered.

Although a load cell was used in the experiments to measure the mass loss rate of the fuel package, the mass loss data
were not reliable enough to reconstruct the HRR curves for each test. Instead, the HRR curves were determined by approximating
the fire growth using a $t^2$ ramp, as in Eq.~(\ref{eq:t_squared}). The parameters for the $t^2$ ramp were calibrated in FDS
by using the temperature measured at the highest thermocouple in the tree (2~cm below the ceiling) in the fire room.
\be
\dot Q = \dot Q_0 \left( \frac{t}{\tau} \right)^2
\label{eq:t_squared}
\ee
A time offset was used to align the predicted ceiling thermocouple temperatures with the measured temperatures.
This offset is reported as the time at which the $t^2$ ramp begins.
The t-squared calibration parameters and time offsets for the HRR ramps are shown in Table~\ref{tab:NIST_Dunes_2000_Summary}.
Additionally, the ignition source had a small effect on the measured ceiling thermocouple temperatures. Therefore,
the size of the ignition source was approximated as either 3~kW or 7~kW, and the time offset of the ignition source was
also calibrated by using the measured ceiling thermocouple temperatures.
The resulting HRR curve was input into CFAST.

A summary of the nine tests selected for model validation is shown in Table~\ref{tab:NIST_Dunes_2000_Summary}.

\section{NIST Vent Study}

A series of 15 reduced-scale enclosure experiments were conducted during the summer of 2017 by Summer Undergraduate Research Fellows (SURF) Fateema Farzana and Cory Schovanec. There is no test report or paper describing these experiments; only what is included here.

\subsubsection{Enclosure Geometry}
\label{Enclosure_Geometry}

A drawing of the enclosure is given in Fig.~\ref{NIST_Vent_Study_Drawing}. The enclosure consisted of two compartments stacked one on top of the other. The interior lateral dimensions of each compartment were 119~cm by 121~cm. The height of the lower compartment was 59~cm, and the upper was 61~cm. The enclosure was located within a vented laboratory space that was approximately 3~m by 3~m by 2.8~m high. The floor of this space was tiled, but a single sheet of gypsum board served as the lower floor of the test enclosure.

The front door was open in all experiments. For some portion of some of the experiments, the second floor was completely sealed. The leakage area was approximately 18~cm$^2$, measured at an over-pressure of 25~Pa.

\caption[Geometry of the compartment from the NIST Vent Study]{Geometry of the compartment from the NIST Vent Study}
\label{NIST_Vent_Study_Drawing}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Material Properties}

The walls, ceiling and floor of each compartment was 1.6~cm (5/8~in) Type~X gypsum board. Wood studs formed the exterior frame. Thermo-physical properties of the gypsum board were taken from in Ref.~\cite{Manzello:SiF08} and manufacturer literature. It was assumed that the specific heat was 1.089~kJ/(kg $\cdot$ K), thermal conductivity 0.15~W/m/K, and density 673~kg/m$^3$.  Additionally, a  layer of kaowool, shown in Fig.~\ref{NIST_Vent_Study_Drawing} was used to seal the gap between the removable roof and the second story walls. Aluminum tape was used to seal all other seams.

\subsubsection{Burner}

For all experiments, a 10~cm square propane burner fueled at a rate of 1.65~L/min generated a 2.5~kW fire according to the following calculation:
\be
   1.65 \frac{\rm L}{\rm min} \times \frac{1}{60} \frac{\rm min}{\rm s} \times \frac{1}{1000} \frac{{\rm m}^3}{\rm L} \times 1.967 \, \frac{\rm kg}{{\rm m}^3} \times 46,300 \, \frac{\rm kJ}{\rm kg} = 2.50 \; {\rm kW}
\label{Conversion_Equation}
\ee
Note that the mass flow controller (Sierra Instruments SmartTrak~50) assumed standard conditions to be 0~$^\circ$C and 101325~Pa. For Tests~13-15, a Dwyer flow meter was used in place of the mass flow controller. The flow meter had a flow range of 4~L/min air.

\subsubsection{Thermocouples}

Eight Type-K thermocouples were inserted at each level to measure the vertical temperature profile. The thermocouples formed a vertical array at 84~cm from the left wall of the enclosure, and 17~cm from the front wall. TC-1 was defined as the uppermost thermocouple, with heights defined as the vertical distance from the compartment specific floor.

\begin{table}[h!]

\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\label{Tab.TC}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Test Procedure}

Each experiment lasted 100~min with a 5~min cool down period. Table~\ref{tab:NIST_Vent_Study} indicates the times when vents and windows were opened after the start of each experiment. For Test No. 1-4, two trials were performed. In each case, the difference in temperature remained within 3 percent, a difference of less than 1~$^\circ$C. For this reason, no further replicates were conducted.

\section{PRISME Project}

PRISME is the name of a fire test program conducted under the auspices of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, Nuclear Energy Agency (OECD/NEA). The experiments were conducted at the French Institut de radioprotection et de s\^{u}ret\'{e} nucl\'{e}aire (IRSN) at Cadarache. A variety of experiments were conducted to study ventilation effects, electrical cable failure, and leakage. The test reports are not publicly available, but an entire edition of {\em Fire Safety Journal} documented various experimental and modeling studies~\cite{Audouin:FSJ}.

The PRISME DOOR series consisted of six experiments, five of which involving two compartments connected by an open door (Tests 1-5) and one involving a third compartment (Test 6). The compartments were 5~m by 6~m by 4~m high. A well-instrumented ventilation system supplied air and exhausted combustion products at specified rates, but the thermal expansion of the gases caused these rates to change, a phenomenon that was intended to test the ventilation capabilities of the models.

\section{SP Adiabatic Surface Temperature Experiments}

In 2008, three compartment experiments were performed at SP Technical Research Institute of Sweden under the sponsorship of Brandforsk, the Swedish Fire Research Board~\cite{Wickstrom_AST}. The objective of the experiments was to demonstrate how plate thermometer measurements in the vicinity of a simple steel beam can be used to supply the boundary conditions for a multi-dimensional heat conduction calculation for the beam. The adiabatic surface temperature was derived from the plate temperatures and used by TASEF, a finite-element
thermal-structural program.

The experiments were performed inside a standard compartment designed for corner fire testing (ISO 9705). The compartment is 3.6~m deep, 2.4~m wide and 2.4~m high and includes a door opening 0.8~m by 2.0~m. The room was constructed of 20~cm thick light weight concrete blocks with a density of 600~kg/m$^3$~$\pm$~100~kg/m$^3$. The heat source was a gas burner run at a constant power of 450~kW. The top of the burner, with a square opening 30~cm by 30~cm, was placed 65~cm above the floor, 2.5~cm from the walls. A single steel beam was suspended 20~cm below the ceiling along the centerline of the compartment. There were three measurement stations along the beam at lengths of 0.9~m (Position A), 1.8~m (Position B), and 2.7~m (Position C) from the far wall where the fire was either positioned in the corner (Tests 1 and 2), or the center (Test 3). The beam in Test 1 was a rectangular steel tube filled with an insulation material. The beam in Tests 2 and 3 was an I-beam.  A diagram of the room used in Test~2 is displayed in Figure~\ref{Room_Drawing}.

A second series of experiments involving plate thermometers was carried out in 2011~\cite{Sjostrom:AST}. A 6~m long, 20~cm diameter vertical steel column was positioned in the center of 1.1~m and 1.9~m diesel fuel and 1.1~m heptane pool fires. Gas, plate thermometer, and surface temperatures were measured at heights of 1~m, 2~m, 3~m, 4~m, and 5~m above the pool surface. These experiments are notable because the column is partially engulfed in flames.

\section{Steckler Compartment Experiments}

Steckler, Quintiere and Rinkinen performed a set of 55 compartment fire tests at NBS in 1979 \cite{Steckler:1982}. The compartment was 2.80~m by 2.80~m by 2.13~m high\footnote{The test report
gives the height of the compartment as 2.18~m. This is a misprint. The compartment was 2.13~m high.}, with a single door of
various widths, or alternatively a single window with various heights. A 30~cm diameter methane burner was used to generate fires with heat release rates of
31.6~kW, 62.9~kW, 105.3~kW and 158~kW. Vertical profiles of velocity and temperature were measured in the doorway, along with a single vertical profile of temperature
within the compartment.
A full description and results are reported in Reference~ \cite{Steckler:1982}. The basic test matrix is listed in Table~\ref{Steckler_Table}. Note that the
test report does not include a detailed description of the compartment. However, an internal report\footnote{ {\em Technical Research Report, Fire Induced Flows
Through Room Openings - Flow Coefficients}, Project 203005-003, Armstrong Cork Company, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, May, 1981.} by the test sponsor, Armstrong Cork Company,
reports that the compartment floor was composed of 19~mm calcium silicate board on top of 12.7~mm plywood on wood joists. The walls and ceiling consisted of
12.7~mm ceramic fiber insulation board over 0.66~mm aluminum sheet attached to wood studs. A diagram of the compartment is displayed in Fig.~\ref{Steckler_ Drawing}.

\section{UL/NFPRF Sprinkler, Vent, and Draft Curtain Study}
\label{UL_NFPRF_Description}

In 1997, a series of 34 heptane spray burner experiments was conducted at the Large Scale Fire Test Facility at Underwriters Laboratories
(UL) in Northbrook, Illinois~\cite{Sheppard:1}. The experiments were divided into two test series. Series I consisted of 22 4.4~MW experiments. Series~II consisted
of 12 10~MW experiments. The objective of the experiments was to characterize the temperature and flow field for fire
scenarios with a controlled heat release rate in the presence of sprinklers, draft curtains, and smoke \& heat vents.

The Large Scale Fire Test Facility at UL contains a 37~m by 37~m (120~ft by 120~ft) main fire test cell, equipped with a 30.5~m by 30.5~m (100~ft by
100~ft) adjustable height ceiling. The layout of the experiments is shown in Figs.~\ref{layout} and \ref{burnerlayoutA}.

\begin{description}
\item[Ceiling:] The ceiling was raised to a height of 7.6~m and instrumented with thermocouples and other measurement devices. The ceiling was constructed of
0.6~m by 1.2~m by 1.6~cm UL fire-rated Armstrong Ceramaguard (Item 602B) ceiling tiles. The manufacturer reported the
thermal properties of the material to be: specific heat 753 J/(kg$\cdot$K), thermal conductivity
0.0611~W/(m$\cdot$K), and density 313~kg/m$^3$.
\item[Draft Curtains:] Sheet metal, 1.2~mm thick and 1.8~m deep, was suspended from the ceiling for 16 of the 22 Series~I tests, enclosing an area of about 450~m$^2$ and 49 sprinklers.
The curtains were in place for all of the Series~II tests.
\item[Sprinklers:] Central ELO-231 (Extra Large Orifice) uprights were used for all the tests. The orifice diameter of this sprinkler is reported by the manufacturer to be
nominally 1.6~cm (0.64~in), the reference actuation temperature is reported by the manufacturer to be 74$^\circ$C (165$^\circ$F). The RTI (Response Time
Index) and C-factor (Conductivity factor) were reported by UL to be 148~(m$\cdot$s)$^\ha$ and 0.7~(m/s)$^\ha$, respectively~\cite{Sheppard:1}.
When installed, the sprinkler deflector was located 8~cm below the ceiling. The thermal
element of the sprinkler was located 11~cm below the ceiling. The sprinklers were installed with nominal 3~m by 3~m (exact 10~ft by 10~ft) spacing in a
system designed to deliver a constant 0.34~L/(s$\cdot$m$^2$) (0.50 gpm/ft$^2$) discharge density when supplied by a 131~kPa (19~psi) discharge
pressure
\item[Vent:] UL-listed double leaf fire vents with steel covers and steel curb were installed in the adjustable height ceiling in the position shown in
Figs.~\ref{layout} and \ref{burnerlayoutA}. The vent is designed to open manually or automatically. The vent doors were recessed into the ceiling about 0.3~m (1~ft).
\item[Heat Release Rate:] The heptane spray burner consisted of a 1~m by 1~m square of 1.3~cm pipe supported by four cement blocks 0.6~m off the floor.
Four atomizing spray nozzles were used to provide a free spray of heptane that was then ignited. For all but one of the Series~I tests, the total heat release
rate from the fire was manually ramped up following a ``t-squared'' curve to a steady-state in 75~s
(150~s was used in Test I-16). The fire was ramped to 10~MW in 75~s for the Series~II tests. The fire growth curve was followed until a specified fire size was
reached or the first sprinkler activated. After either of these events, the fire size was maintained at that level until conditions reached roughly a
steady state, i.e., the temperatures recorded near the ceilings remained steady and no more sprinkler activations occurred.
The heat release rate from the burner was confirmed by placing it under the large product calorimeter at UL, ramping up the flow of heptane in the
same manner as in the tests, and measuring the total and convective heat release rates. It was found that the convective heat release rate was
0.65~$\pm$~0.02 of the total.
\item[Instrumentation:] The instrumentation for the tests consisted of thermocouples, gas analysis equipment, and pressure transducers. The locations of the instrumentation
are referenced in the plan view of the facility (Fig.~\ref{layout}).
Temperature measurements were recorded at 104 locations. Type K 0.0625~in diameter Inconel sheathed thermocouples were positioned to measure (i)
temperatures near the ceiling, (ii) temperatures of the ceiling jet, and (iii) temperatures near the vent.

\section{UL/NIJ House Experiments}
\label{UL_NIJ_Description}

The Firefighter Safety Research Institute (FSRI) of Underwriters Laboratory (UL), with support from the National Institute of Justice (NIJ), conducted fire experiments in a one-story ranch-style house and a two-story colonial-style house in the large fire facility at Northbrook, Illinois, in 2016 and 2017~\cite{Madrzykowski:2019}. The goal of the experiments was to determine the effect of ventilation on fire patterns in fully-furnished homes. As part of the project, a natural gas burner was positioned within the unfurnished structures to evaluate changes in flow patterns as various doors and windows were opened and closed. The test structures were instrumented with thermocouple trees, pressure transducers, and bi-directional probes. The floor plan for the single story ranch-style house is included in Fig.~\ref{Ranch_layout}, and plans for the two story colonial-style house in Fig.~\ref{Colonial_layout}. The ceiling was 2.4~m above the floor in the ranch-style house. The colonial-style house featured an atrium with a 5.6~m ceiling height. The first story ceiling in the colonial-style house was 2.5~m above the floor, and the second story ceiling was 2.8~m above the floor.

The leakage area in the single story structure was measured to be 0.08~m$^2$ at 10~Pa. The leakage area in the two story structure was measured to be 0.18~m$^2$ at 10~Pa.

The natural gas burner in each set of experiments had dimensions of 0.6~m by 0.6~m, and the surface of the burner was approximately 0.6~m above the floor. The heat release rate for the single story ranch house was 250~kW, and 500~kW for the two story colonial. The locations of the burner in each house are indicated in the floor plans. The labels for the measurement devices in the one and two story houses are listed in Tables~\ref{Ranch_devices} and~\ref{Colonial_devices}, respectively. Three experiments with unique sequences of events (e.g. opening doors and windows) were conducted in each style of house. All experiments began with all exterior doors and windows closed and the times at which each door and window was opened are listed Table~\ref{Ranch_events} and~\ref{Colonial_events}.

\section{UL/NIST Vent Experiments}
\label{UL_NIST_Vents_Description}

In 2012, the Fire Fighting Technology Group at NIST conducted experiments at Underwriters Laboratories (UL) in Northbrook, Illinois, to assess the change in compartment temperature due to the opening of one or two 1.2~m square ceiling vents \cite{Opert:2012}. Four experiments were conducted using a natural gas burner in a 6.1~m by 4.3~m by 2.4~m compartment with a single door opening. The fires ranged in size from 500~kW to 2~MW, and the vents were opened and closed such that during the four experiments there were 31 discrete time intervals in which model predictions could be compared to quasi-steady conditions. The compartment contained two vertical arrays of thermocouples, and the door and vents were instrumented with thermocouples and bi-directional velocity probes. Only the thermocouple data has been used in the validation study. A diagram of the compartment is displayed in Figure~\ref{UL_NIST_Drawing}. The major test parameters are listed in Table~\ref{UL_NIST_Table}.

\section{USN High Bay Hangar Experiments}

The U.S. Navy sponsored a series of 33 tests within two hangars examining fire detection and sprinkler activation in response to spill fires in large enclosures \cite{Gott:1997, Davis:2000}. Experiments were conducted using JP-5 and JP-8 fuels in two Navy high bay aircraft hangars located in Naval Air Stations in Barber's Point, Hawaii and Keflavik, Iceland.

The Hawaii tests were conducted in a 15~m high hangar measuring 97.8~m in length and 73.8~m in width. Of the 13 tests conducted in the facility 11 were conducted in pans ranging from .09~m$^2$ to 4.9~m$^2$ in area with heat release rates varying from 100~kW to 7.7~MW. The burner was placed in the center of the room on a scale that continuously recorded the pans weight. The facility was equipped with a number of detection devices including thermocouples, electronic smoke and spot heat detectors, projected beam smoke detectors, combination UV/IR optical flame detectors, line-type heat detectors, as well as sprinklers. Measurements were recorded at a large number of locations allowing for a through profile of compartment behavior.

It was suspected that fire plume behavior and response of detection devices in a cold building may not have been well replicated by the experiments held in the warm hangar in Hawaii. The Iceland tests were conducted under a 22~m barrel vaulted ceiling in a hangar measuring 45.7~m by 73.8~m. 22 tests in total were conducted. The majority of these tests fires burned JP-5 fuel with the remainder burning JP-8. The jet fuel fires ranged in size from .06~m$^2$ to 20.9~m$^2$ and in heat release rate from 100~kW to approximately 33~MW. The facility was equipped similarly to the Hawaii hangar.

\section{Vettori Flat Ceiling Experiments}

Vettori~\cite{Vettori:1} analyzed a series of 45 experiments conducted at NIST that were intended to compare the effects of different ceiling configurations on the activation times of quick response residential pendent sprinklers. The two ceiling configurations used consisted of an obstructed ceiling, with parallel beams 0.038~m wide by 0.24~m deep placed 0.41~m on center, and a smooth ceiling configuration, in which the beams were covered by a sheet of gypsum board.  In addition to the two ceiling configurations, there were also three fire growth rates and three burner locations used -- a total of 18 test configurations. The fire growth rate was provided by a computer controlled methane gas burner to mimic a standard t-squared fire growth rate with either a slow, medium, or fast ramp up. The burner was placed in a corner of the room, then against an adjacent wall, and then in a location removed from any wall. Measurements were taken to record sprinkler activation time, temperatures at varying heights and locations within the room, and the ceiling jet velocities at several other locations.  A diagram of the test structure is displayed in Figure~\ref{Vettori_Drawing}.

\section{VTT Large Hall Tests}

The experiments are described in Ref.~\cite{Hostikka:2001}. The series consisted of 8 experiments, but because of replicates only three unique fire scenarios. The experiments were undertaken to study the movement of smoke in a large hall with a sloped ceiling. The tests were conducted inside the VTT Fire Test Hall, with dimensions of 19~m high by 27~m long by 14~m wide. Each test involved a single heptane pool fire, ranging from 2~MW to 4~MW. Four types of predicted output were used in the present evaluation -- the HGL temperature and depth, average flame height and the plume temperature. Three vertical arrays of thermocouples (TC), plus two thermocouples in the plume, were compared to CFAST predictions. The HGL temperature and height were reduced from an average of the three TC arrays using the standard algorithm described in Chapter~\ref{HGL:Chapter}. The ceiling jet temperature was not considered, because the ceiling in the test hall is not flat, and the standard model algorithm is not appropriate for this geometry.

The VTT test report lacks some information needed to model the experiments, which is why some information was based on private communications with the
principal investigator, Simo Hostikka.
\begin{description}
\item[Surface Materials:] The walls and ceiling of the test hall consist of a 1~mm thick layer of sheet metal on top of a 5~cm layer of mineral wool. The floor was constructed of concrete. The report does not provide thermal properties of these materials.
\item[Natural Ventilation:] In Cases~1 and 2, all doors were closed, and ventilation was restricted to infiltration through the building envelope. Precise information on air infiltration during these tests is not available. The scientists who conducted the experiments recommend a leakage area of about 2~m$^2$, distributed uniformly throughout the enclosure. By contrast, in Case~3, the doors located in each end wall (Doors 1 and 2, respectively) were open to the external ambient environment. These doors are each 0.8~m wide by 4~m high, and are located such that their centers are 9.3~m from the south wall.
\item[Mechanical Ventilation:] The test hall has a single mechanical exhaust duct, located in the roof space, running along the center of the building. This duct had a circular section with a diameter of 1~m, and opened horizontally to the hall at a distance of 12~m from the floor and 10.5~m from the west wall. Mechanical exhaust ventilation was operational for Case~3, with a constant volume flow rate of 11~m$^3$/s drawn through the exhaust duct.
\item[Heat Release Rate:] Each test used a single liquid fuel pan with its center located 16~m from the west wall and 7.4~m from the south wall. For all tests, the fuel was heptane in a circular steel pan that was partially filled with water. The pan had a diameter of 1.17~m for Case~1 and 1.6~m for Cases~2 and 3. In each case, the fuel surface was 1~m above the floor. The trays were placed on load cells, and the HRR was calculated from the mass loss rate. For the three cases, the fuel mass loss rate was averaged from individual replicate tests. In the HRR estimation, the heat of combustion (taken as 44,600~kJ/kg) and the combustion efficiency for n-heptane was used. Hostikka suggests a value of 0.8 for the combustion efficiency. Tewarson reports a value of 0.93 for a 10~cm pool fire~\cite{Tewarson:2003}. For the calculations reported in the current study, a combustion efficiency of 0.85 is assumed. In general, an uncertainty of 15~\% has been assumed for the reported HRR of most of the large scale fire experiments used.
\item[Radiative Fraction:] The radiative fraction was assumed to be 0.35, similar to many smoky hydrocarbons.

\section{WTC Spray Burner Test Series}

As part of its investigation of the World Trade Center disaster, the Building and Fire Research Laboratory at NIST conducted several series of fire experiments to both gain insight into the
observed fire behavior and to validate FDS for use in reconstructing the fires. The first series of experiments involved a relatively simple compartment with a liquid spray burner and
various structural elements with varying amounts of sprayed fire-resistive materials (SFRM). A diagram of the compartment is shown in figure~\ref{WTC_Drawing}.
A complete description of the experiments can be found in the NIST WTC report NCSTAR~1-5B~\cite{NIST_NCSTAR_1-5B}.
The overall enclosure was rectangular, as were the vents and most of the obstructions. The compartment walls and ceiling were made of 2.54~cm thick marinite. The manufacturer provided the thermal properties of the material used in the calculation. The density was 737~kg/m$^3$, conductivity 0.12~W/m/K, and the specific heat ranged from 1.17~kJ/kg/K at 93~$^\circ$C to
1.42~kJ/kg/K at 425~$^\circ$C. This value was assumed for higher temperatures.
The steel used to construct the column and truss flanges was 0.64~cm thick.  The density of the steel was assumed to be 7,860~kg/m$^3$; its specific heat 0.45~kJ/kg/K.

Two fuels were used in the tests. The properties of the fuels were obtained from measurements made on a series of unconfined burns that are referenced in the test report.
The first fuel was a blend of heptane isomers, C$_7$H$_{16}$. Its soot yield in CFAST was set at a constant 1.5~\%. The second fuel was a mixture (40~\% - 60~\% by volume) of toluene, C$_7$H$_8$,
and heptane. Because a fire in CFAST only considers the burning of a single hydrocarbon fuel, the mixture was taken to be C$_7$H$_{12}$ with a soot yield of 11.2~\%.
The radiative fraction for the heptane blend was 0.44; for the heptane/toluene mixture it was 0.39.
The heat release rate of the simulated burner was set to that which was measured in the experiments with the fire placed on the floor at the center of the fire pan.

\section{Summary of Experiments}

\label{experiment_summary}

Experiments were chosen for inclusion based on several criteria: 1) Are the experiments well-documented in publicly-available publications in terms of physical parameters such as compartment geometry, ventilation, and fire characteristics? 2) Is the experimental data publicly available? 3) Do the experiments extend the range of one or more of the test parameters described below to broaden the scope of the validation?

Table~\ref{Test_Parameters} presents a summary of all the experiments described in this chapter in terms of parameters commonly used in fire protection engineering. This ``parameter space'' outlines the range of applicability of the validation studies performed to date. In other words, if this guide is to be cited as justification for using CFAST to simulate a given fire scenario, that scenario must be similar to these experiments in the sense of having comparable physical parameters. These parameters are explained below:
\begin{description}
\item[Heat Release Rate, $\dQ$,] is the range of peak heat release rates of the fires in the test series.
\item[Fire Diameter, $D$,] is the equivalent diameter of the base of the fire, calculated $D=\sqrt{4A/\pi}$, where $A$ is the area of the base.
\item[Ceiling Height, $H$,] is the distance from floor to ceiling.
\item[Fire Froude Number, $\dot{Q}^*$,] is a useful non-dimensional quantity for plume correlations and flame height estimates. \be \dot{Q}^* = \frac{\dot{Q}}{\rho_\infty c_p T_\infty \sqrt{gD} D^2} \ee It is essentially the ratio of the fuel gas exit velocity and the buoyancy-induced plume velocity. Jet fires are characterized by large Froude numbers. Typical accidental fires have a Froude number near unity.
\item[Flame Height relative to Ceiling Height, $L_{\rm f}/H$,] is a convenient way to express the physical size of the fire relative to the size of the room. The height of the visible flame, based on Heskestad's correlation, is estimated by: \be L_{\rm f} = D \, \left( 3.7 \, (\dot{Q}^*)^{2/5} - 1.02 \right) \ee
\item[Global Equivalence Ratio, $\phi$,] is the ratio of the mass flux of fuel to the mass flux of oxygen into the compartment, divided by the stoichiometric ratio. \be \phi = \frac{\dm_{\rm f}}{r\, \dm_{\hbox{\tiny O$_2$}}} \equiv  \frac{\dQ \; \hbox{(kW)}}{13,100 \; \hbox{(kJ/kg)} \; \dm_{\hbox{\tiny O$_2$}} } \quad ; \quad  \dm_{\hbox{\tiny O$_2$}} = \left\{
     \begin{array}{r@{\quad:\quad}l}
      \ha \, 0.23 \, A_0 \sqrt{H_0} & \hbox{Natural Ventilation} \\
      0.23 \, \rho \, \dot{V}       & \hbox{Mechanical Ventilation} \end{array} \right. \ee Here, $r$ is the stoichiometric ratio, $A_0$ is the area of the compartment opening, $H_0$ is the height of the opening, $\rho$ is the density of air, and $\dot{V}$ is the volume flow of air into the compartment. If $\phi<1$, the compartment is considered ``well-ventilated'' and if $\phi>1$, the compartment is considered ``under-ventilated.''
\item[Compartment Aspect Ratios, $W/H$ and $L/H$,] indicate if the compartment is shaped like a hallway, typical room, or vertical shaft.
\item[Relative Distance along the Ceiling, $r_{\rm cj}/H$,] indicates the distance from the fire plume of a sprinkler, smoke detector, etc., relative to the compartment height, $H$.
\item[Relative Distance from the Fire, $r_{\rm rad}/D$,] indicates whether a ``target'' is near or far from the fire.
