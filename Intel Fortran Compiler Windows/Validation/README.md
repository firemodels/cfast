# CFAST Validation

The folders above contain the CFAST input files for the CFAST validation suite. These cases are run and processed with each minor release of CFAST. The experimental data is found in another repository [firemodels/exp](https://github.com/firemodels/exp). Publically available test reports may be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B-EZ4HlrI6VDT2R5SjNFOGtIdTg).

Detailed instructions for running and processing the validation cases is found in the wiki called [CFASTbot](https://github.com/firemodels/cfast/wiki/CFASTbot). More information on the validation process can be found in the FDS wiki pages (CFAST uses the same process as FDS) [FDS Validation Process](https://github.com/firemodels/fds/wiki/FDS-Validation-Process).
